About:
This is the draft of a facebook app where users can select some events they have formerly created then add them to a dashbord.
I'm trying from the events list ('/dashboard/events') to add an event to the dashboard via post

Requirement:
- a facebook account (or test account)
- facebook app
- a couple of facebook events

or simply try to execute a post request from a link via ajax

#How to:

1. From root, login with facebook
2. Go to /dashboard/events
3. Click on 'add to dashboard'. Expected: 200 response
